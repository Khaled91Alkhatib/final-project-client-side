            <h3>REGENERATIVE LEATHER</h3>
            <div>
              Sourced from farms that use regenerative agricultural practices. This technique gives land a rest so it can absorb carbon, retain water and restore biodiversity to the pastures where the cattle graze. That means not only minimizing negative impact, but potentially having a net positive impact on the land.
